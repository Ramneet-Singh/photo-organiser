I want to create a photo organiser app. It should be cross-platform, but I'll primarily use it on the web for now. I have two use cases in mind (for now, will add more later). The first is that I can point the app to a folder with lots of photos. It will go through them and collect people and their faces. Then, I can filter the photos for containing selected people and copy the matching photos to another folder. The second is that the app can filter all the photos to select "irrelevant" pictures (memes, good morning messages, and similar stuff, basically not important documents or personal pictures). Then it can show me the photos one-by-one (this should be possible to pause and resume since I want to look at a few pictures everyday), prompt me to confirm whether this should be moved, and then move it to another folder. Use the prd-generator skill to create a comprehensive PRD.
